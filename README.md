This repository demonstrates a common Node.js issue: blocking the event loop with a long-running synchronous operation.  The `server.js` file shows a server that hangs because of a computationally intensive loop within the request handler. The `serverSolution.js` file provides a solution using asynchronous operations to prevent the event loop from blocking and keep the server responsive.
